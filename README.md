# BarleyZP's HorseReality Tools

### About
I created this set of tools for a friend of mine who plays the game at horsereality.com.
You can check the app out at https://barleyzp-hr-tools.onrender.com/.

### Credits
Huge thank-you to Shay of the Realtools site for providing an initial api to work with which 
I was able to build off of for my own web scraping. Their client library and guidance was 
extrememly helpful in my pursuit of this project. See their website code and client library 
[here](https://github.com/hr-tools).
