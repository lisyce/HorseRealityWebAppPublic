# BarleyZP's HorseReality Tools

### About
I created this set of tools for a friend of mine who plays the game at horsereality.com.
Due to the unprecedented introduction of a recaptcha on the login page (despite applications such 
as this one being explicitly within the HorseReality TOS), the application is no longer capable of its main web scraping feature. Should this change, I will update my codebase
and re-host the website. Until then, the codebase is available for anyone to look through.

### Credits
Huge thank-you to Shay of the Realtools site for providing an initial api to work with which 
I was able to build off of for my own web scraping. Their client library and guidance was 
extrememly helpful in my pursuit of this project. See their website code and client library 
[here](https://github.com/hr-tools).
