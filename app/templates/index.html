                Warning: this application is limited in how many requests it can send to HorseReality Servers at a time.
                If you have lots of horses, this can take several minutes! (Estimated: 10 minutes for 300 horses).
                I'm considering a feature that caches your data as you browse the site in the future to save some time.
                To further work with your data, you can download your it as a CSV file, which is able to be imported into most spreadsheet programs.
